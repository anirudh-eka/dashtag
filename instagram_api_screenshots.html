		<p>Dashtag sets up an application for you that interacts with Instagram. To allow your Dashtag page to access Instagram, Instagram requires you to register your page and gives you a 'key' that you'll have to input back into your Dashtag page's settings. Below are directions with screenshots to guide you through this process.</p>
