What is Dashtag?

The hastag displayer is a light weight rails application that pulls tweets with a particular hashtag and displays them using [masonry](http://masonry.desandro.com/). The app is pretty much plug and play. The only changes you have to make is in the .env file.

The application uses [Twitter's REST API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/search/tweets) and [Instagram's REST API](http://instagram.com/developer/). Please note this is not an exhaustive list of all tweets/instagrams with a particular hashtag.

Check out the example of Hashtag Displayer [here on our staging site](http://hashtag-displayer-staging-1.herokuapp.com/).

Environment Variables
---------------------
Currently the application uses the following variables in the environment:
- HEADER_TITLE (default: user's hashtags separated by spaces)
- HEADER_LINK (default: will link to top of page)
- HEADER_COLOR (default: #EFEFEF)
- BACKGROUND_COLOR (default: #EFEFEF)
- FONT_FAMILY (default: Open Sans, sans-serif)
-	POST_COLOR_1	(default: #B11C54)
-	POST_COLOR_2	(default: #F78F31)
-	POST_COLOR_3	(default: #80C9D2)
-	POST_COLOR_4	(default: #B5B935)
-	HASHTAGS
- TWITTER_USERS
- INSTAGRAM_USERS
- INSTAGRAM_USER_IDS
-	CENSORED_WORDS
-	CENSORED_USERS
- API_RATE (default: 6 seconds * hashtag_count)
-	TWITTER_BEARER_CREDENTIALS
- INSTAGRAM_CLIENT_ID
-	DISABLE_RETWEETS (default: true)
-	DB_ROW_LIMIT (default: 8000)

To add a custom page title to your feed as well as a header title, you set:

	HEADER_TITLE=My Custom Title

If no title is provided the default title will be set as the user's hashtags separated by spaces. For example, for the given HASHTAGS=peace|love|happiness, the header title will display

	#peace #love #happiness

To add an external link to your header title, you set:

	HEADER_LINK=https://www.google.com

* You must use absolute urls for links to work.

To add a custom header color, you set:

	HEADER_COLOR="#B11C54" or "maroon" or "rgba(250,0,0,0.2)"

To add custom colors for the post background, you can set:

	POST_COLOR_1="#B11C54" or "maroon" or "rgba(250,0,0,0.2)"

To add custom background page color, you can set:

	BACKGROUND_COLOR="#B11C54" or "maroon" or "rgba(250,0,0,0.2)"

* All color values must be wrapped in quotes!

To change the text font of the feed, you can set:

	FONT_FAMILY=Tahoma, Geneva, sans-serif

* The font_family input must not have quotes and can be separated by commas as shown above

`Hashtags` should be set to the text of the hashtag excluding the initial '#'. So if you wanted all of the posts with the "#peace" on Twitter, you set:

	HASHTAGS=peace

If you want to see posts for multiple hashtags, simply delimit them with "|", like so

	HASHTAGS=peace|love|happiness

If you want to see posts for specific Twitter Users, simply delimit them with "|", like so

	TWITTER_USERS=screen_name|twitter_user|happy_user

* You may use INSTAGRAM_USERS and/or INSTAGRAM_USER_IDS to determine which Instagram users to follow.

If you want to see posts for specific Instagram Users by user_name, simply delimit them with "|", like so

	INSTAGRAM_USERS=kingjames|trey5

If you want to see posts for specific Instagram Users by user_id, simply delimit them with "|", like so

	INSTAGRAM_USER_IDS=19410587|18808100

To prevent from storing posts with certain words set the environment variable `CENSORED_WORDS` to the words you dont want to include in the .env file. For example, to censor posts that contain the word, "question", add the following line in the .env file:

	CENSORED_WORDS=questions

If you want censor multiple words, simply delimit them with "|", like so

	CENSORED_WORDS=questions|answers|censored

To prevent from storing posts from certain users set the environment variable `CENSORED_USERS` to the users you dont want to include in the .env file. For example, to censor posts by the author, "badGuy", add the following line in the .env file:

	CENSORED_USERS=badGuy

If you want to censor multiple users, simply delimit them with "|", like so

	CENSORED_USERS=badGuy|UglyDog

If you don't want to censor users or words, simply don't put `CENSORED_USERS` or `CENSORED_WORDS` in the .env file.

"API_RATE" allows the user to set the interval at which the application calls the Twitter/Instagram API. The default rate is used to remain under the maximum request limit for both social media APIs for standard credentials. A user may change the rate in seconds (at the risk of exceeding the request limit and being temporary timed out), like so:

	API_RATE=15

Refer to Twitter API Limits [here](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limiting).

Refer to Instagram API Limits [here](http://instagram.com/developer/limits/).

`Twitter Bearer Credentials` should be set to the Twitter Key followed by a colon and the Twitter secret, like so:

	TWITTER_BEARER_CREDENTIALS=your_twitter_key:your_twitter_secret

To find the key and secret for your app follow these [directions](https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/overview/application-owner-access-tokens). This will require you to register your own Twitter application. Also, in case you were wondering, the application uses [application-only authentication](https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/application-only).

`Instagram Client Id` should be set to the client id you get back from [registering your application with Instagram](http://instagram.com/developer/clients/register/). Where it prompts for `Website` and `OAuth redirect_uri:` and you will need to put your site's address.  You should not need to change the defaults for `Disable implicit OAuth` or `Enforce signed header`.  You only need the CLIENT_ID that they give you, not the secret or anything else.

The application by default does not capture retweet posts from twitter. To capture retweets, set the `DISABLE_RETWEETS`, environment variable to 'false'.

The application by default limits the amount of posts saved in the db to 8000. Once that limit is reached for each new post added the oldest post *determined by the time it was posted on instagram/twitter (and not when it was entered into the db)* is deleted. To change the limit, set `DB_ROW_LIMIT` to the number of rows you would prefer.

Background colors of the posts can also be customized by setting `COLOR_1`, `COLOR_2`, `COLOR_3`, and `COLOR_4` to the hexidecimal(starting with the '#'). By default the colors are "#B11C54", "#F78F31", "#80C9D2", and "#B5B935".

To Run Locally
---------------
To set up the application locally you should first create a new file called `.env` in the root dir of the app. After pulling the app into a local repository on your machine, create a .env file at the root of your repository. This is where you can set environment variable that will be available to your application, but ignored by git (thanks to [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv)).

Your final .env file should look like this:

	HASHTAG=peace
	CENSORED_WORDS=dictatorship|wowza|more
	TWITTER_BEARER_CREDENTIALS=YOUR_TWITTER_KEY:YOUR_TWITTER_SECRET
	INSTAGRAM_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_INSTAGRAM_CLIENT_ID_CODE

Contribute to Engine
---------------------

Clone the repo:

	$ git clone https://github.com/anirudh-eka/dashtag.git

create/migrate the test database:

	$ cd dashtag
	$ rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test

run the tests (make sure they are passing before doing anything else):

	$ rspec


Running the dummy app
---------------------

If you want to see what the engine would look live you can run the dummy app. First migrate the db:

	$ rake db:migrate

Then change directories to the dummy app:

	$ cd spec/dummy

Here you can run rails commands that you would run at the root of a rails app. To start the server:

	$ rails s 


If everything worked you should be able to see the application at work at http://localhost:3000/ in your favorite browser.
