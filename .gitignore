# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
*.sqlite3

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
*.log
log
!/spec/dummy/log/.keep
/spec/dummy/tmp

# Ignore .env
/spec/dummy/.env

# Ignore migrations in dummy
/spec/dummy/db/migrate/*.rb

# Ignore db file in dummy
/spec/dummy/db/*
